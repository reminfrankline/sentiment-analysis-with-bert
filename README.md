# Sentiment Analysis with BERT

This repository contains code for performing sentiment analysis using the BERT model. It includes a Streamlit web application that allows users to input text and receive sentiment analysis predictions.

## Overview

The sentiment analysis model is built using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, a state-of-the-art natural language processing model developed by Google. The model is fine-tuned on a dataset containing labeled tweets with sentiment labels (neutral, good, bad).

## Usage

To run the Streamlit web application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reminfrankline/sentiment-analysis-with-bert.git
```
## Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- Pyngrok

## Dataset

The sentiment analysis model is trained on a dataset containing labeled tweets. The dataset used for training and evaluation is not provided in this repository.

## Acknowledgments

The code in this repository is based on tutorials and examples from the Hugging Face Transformers documentation and Streamlit documentation.
